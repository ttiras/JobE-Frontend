## Architecture Decisions Documented

### Automatic Platform Features (Nhost Managed)

**Session Management**:
- Nhost SDK automatically refreshes tokens every 15 minutes
- No manual token refresh logic needed
- Session duration: 24 hours (configurable)
- Session state managed by Nhost SDK (no separate session table)

**Database Migrations**:
- Hasura automatically creates migrations when:
  - Tables are added/modified in Nhost console
  - Permissions/RLS policies change
  - Events are configured
- Migrations are automatically pushed to GitHub on next commit
- No manual migration tool commands needed

**Observability**:
- Nhost provides built-in monitoring dashboard
- Metrics: API response times, error rates, throughput
- Alerting configured in Nhost console
- Structured logging at info/warn/error levels

**Infrastructure**:
- PostgreSQL managed by Nhost
- Encryption at rest provided by Nhost
- HTTPS/WSS connections enforced
- Database transactions handled by Hasura

## Execution Guidance

### Critical Path (MVP)
```
Phase 1 (Setup, 7 tasks)
  ‚Üì
Phase 2 (Foundational, 16 tasks) ‚Üê BLOCKS all user stories
  ‚Üì
Phase 3 (US1: Auth, 32 tasks)
  ‚Üì
Phase 4 (US5: Session, 8 tasks)
  ‚Üì
MVP COMPLETE (63 tasks total, ~3-4 weeks)
```

### Full Feature Set
```
MVP (63 tasks)
  ‚Üì
Phase 5 (US2: Files, 22 tasks) || Phase 6 (US3: GraphQL, 28 tasks) ‚Üê Parallel (requires backend ready)
  ‚Üì
Phase 7 (Polish, 20 tasks)
  ‚Üì
FULL FEATURE SET (133 frontend tasks total, ~5-6 weeks)
```

### Parallel Opportunities
- Setup phase: 4 tasks can run in parallel
- Foundational: 7 tasks can run in parallel
- After foundational: US2 and US3 can proceed in parallel (US3 requires backend API)
- Test suites: 5-8 tests can run in parallel per user story

**Backend Dependency**: US3 (Data Management) requires backend team to implement database schema and GraphQL API first.

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: üü¢ LOW

**Mitigated Risks**:
- ‚úÖ No custom authentication logic (using proven Nhost SDK)
- ‚úÖ No manual session management (Nhost handles automatically)
- ‚úÖ Backend in separate repository (clear separation of concerns)
- ‚úÖ No real-time complexity (removed subscriptions)
- ‚úÖ Clear RBAC implementation path (added tasks)
- ‚úÖ Account deletion with cascade verified (added test)

**Remaining Risks** (LOW):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Nhost service availability (mitigated by 99.9% SLA)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend team coordination (schema changes require alignment)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è reCAPTCHA API key management (standard practice)

---

## Final Recommendation

### ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Status**: All critical issues resolved, specification is production-ready.

**Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Coordinate with backend team on schema implementation (data-model.md)
2. ‚úÖ Proceed with frontend implementation (133 tasks)
3. ‚úÖ Follow TDD strictly (tests first, then implementation)
4. ‚úÖ Start with MVP scope (63 tasks, US1 + US5) - can proceed immediately
5. ‚úÖ US3 implementation waits for backend API readiness
6. ‚úÖ Reference quickstart.md for setup procedures

**Frontend ready. MVP has no backend dependencies (authentication managed by Nhost).**
