# Feature Specification: Nhost Integration for Authentication, Storage, and Database

**Feature Branch**: `002-nhost-integration`  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add nhost for authentication, storage and database(postgres with graphql)"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: How should the system handle concurrent updates to the same record by different users? → A: No collaborative editing - single user per client, standard last-write-wins is sufficient
- Q: How should account deletion and data retention be handled? → A: Immediate hard delete - account and all data permanently removed instantly
- Q: What rate limiting should be applied to login failures? → A: 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout, with CAPTCHA after 3 attempts
- Q: What level of observability and monitoring is required? → A: Comprehensive logging (info, warn, error) with detailed metrics and alerting
- Q: How should file upload handle network failures? → A: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Authentication (Priority: P1)

Users need to securely sign up, log in, and manage their accounts to access the JobE platform. This includes email/password authentication, session management, and password recovery.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation for all other features. Without it, users cannot access any protected functionality. This is the critical path for user onboarding.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an account, logging in, logging out, and resetting a password. Delivers immediate value by enabling secure user access to the platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they provide email and password, **Then** an account is created and they are logged in
2. **Given** an existing user with valid credentials, **When** they enter email and password, **Then** they are logged in and redirected to their dashboard
3. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they click logout, **Then** their session ends and they are redirected to the login page
4. **Given** a user forgot their password, **When** they request password reset, **Then** they receive a reset email with a secure link
5. **Given** a user clicks a password reset link, **When** they enter a new password, **Then** their password is updated and they can log in with new credentials
6. **Given** an invalid login attempt, **When** wrong credentials are provided, **Then** a clear error message is displayed without revealing whether email exists

### User Story 2 - File Storage (Priority: P2)

Users need to upload and manage files such as resumes, profile photos, and documents related to job applications. The system must handle file uploads, downloads, and deletions securely.

**Why this priority**: File management is essential for job applications but can function after basic authentication. Users can still browse and create profiles without immediate file upload capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading a file, retrieving it, and deleting it. Delivers value by enabling document management for job applications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they upload a resume file (PDF, DOC, DOCX), **Then** the file is stored and a confirmation is shown
2. **Given** a user has uploaded files, **When** they view their files list, **Then** all uploaded files are displayed with names, sizes, and upload dates
3. **Given** a user wants to download a file, **When** they click download, **Then** the file is retrieved and downloaded to their device
4. **Given** a user wants to remove a file, **When** they delete it, **Then** the file is removed from storage and no longer accessible
5. **Given** a user uploads a file larger than the limit, **When** upload is attempted, **Then** a clear error message is displayed with the size limit
6. **Given** a user uploads an unsupported file type, **When** upload is attempted, **Then** a clear error message lists supported file types

### User Story 3 - Data Management via GraphQL (Priority: P2)

Users and administrators need to create, read, update, and delete data (organizations, positions, questionnaires, applications) efficiently. The system provides a consistent interface for all data operations.

**Why this priority**: Core business data operations are essential but can be developed after authentication. Some functionality may work with mock data during authentication development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new organization, updating its details, querying all organizations, and deleting it. Delivers value by enabling complete CRUD operations on business entities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authorized user, **When** they create a new organization with required fields, **Then** the organization is stored and assigned a unique identifier
2. **Given** an existing organization, **When** a user queries for it, **Then** all organization details are returned accurately
3. **Given** an authorized user, **When** they update organization details, **Then** changes are saved and reflected immediately
4. **Given** an authorized user, **When** they delete an organization, **Then** it is removed and no longer appears in queries
5. **Given** multiple users querying data simultaneously, **When** data is updated, **Then** all users see the latest changes
6. **Given** a user without proper permissions, **When** they attempt unauthorized operations, **Then** the action is blocked with a clear permission error

---

### User Story 4 - Real-time Data Synchronization (Priority: P3)

Users need to see their data updates reflected immediately across browser tabs or after making changes. For example, when a user posts a new job position in one tab, it appears in other open tabs without manual refresh.

**Why this priority**: Real-time updates enhance user experience but are not critical for core functionality. The system can function with manual refresh initially. Most clients use single-user workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the same view in two browser tabs, making a change in one tab, and verifying the other tab updates automatically. Delivers value by improving user experience across multiple tabs/windows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has the same page open in two browser tabs, **When** they update data in one tab, **Then** the other tab reflects the change immediately
2. **Given** a user viewing a list of applications, **When** a new application is submitted, **Then** the list updates automatically to include the new application
3. **Given** a user receives updates, **When** multiple rapid changes occur, **Then** updates are batched appropriately to avoid UI flickering

---

### User Story 5 - Session Management and Security (Priority: P1)

Users need their sessions to remain secure with automatic logout after inactivity, and the system must protect against unauthorized access across all operations.

**Why this priority**: Security is non-negotiable and must be built into authentication from the start. This runs parallel to basic authentication implementation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by leaving a session idle, verifying automatic logout, and attempting to access protected resources without valid session. Delivers value by protecting user data and maintaining security compliance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in but inactive, **When** the inactivity timeout is reached, **Then** they are logged out automatically and redirected to login
2. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they attempt to access protected resources, **Then** they are redirected to login page
3. **Given** a user with an expired session token, **When** they make a request, **Then** they are prompted to re-authenticate
4. **Given** a user logs in on multiple devices, **When** they log out on one device, **Then** all active sessions across all devices are terminated

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the database connection is temporarily lost?
- What happens when a user's authentication token expires during a long-running operation?
- How does the system handle special characters in user input (emails, names, file names)?
- What happens when storage quota is reached?
- How are database migrations handled without downtime?
