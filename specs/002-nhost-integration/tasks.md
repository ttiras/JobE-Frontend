## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) ‚úÖ

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Nhost configuration

- [x] T001 [P] Install Nhost dependencies: `@nhost/nextjs`, `@nhost/nhost-js`, `graphql`, `@graphql-codegen/*` packages
- [x] T002 [P] Create environment configuration files: `.env.local` with local Nhost settings (subdomain=local)
- [x] T003 [P] Create environment template: `.env.staging` with staging settings (subdomain=bgkrpcjhawoxjnfxufdf, region=eu-central-1)
- [x] T004 Configure Nhost client in `lib/nhost/client.ts` with environment variables
- [x] T005 [P] Setup GraphQL Code Generator config in `codegen.ts` for TypeScript type generation

- [x] T007 [P] Configure reCAPTCHA v3 credentials in environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`, `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`)

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Basic Nhost configuration complete, environment variables configured

**Note**: Hasura automatically creates database migrations when schema/permissions change. Migrations are pushed to GitHub on next commit.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Shared Infrastructure) ‚úÖ

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T008 Create NhostProvider in `components/providers/nhost-provider.tsx` wrapping app with Nhost context
- [x] T009 Update root layout in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` to include NhostProvider
- [x] T010 Create AuthContext in `lib/contexts/auth-context.tsx` for authentication state management (Note: Nhost manages session state internally)
- [x] T011 Create authentication utilities in `lib/nhost/auth.ts` (login, logout, register, password reset helpers)
- [x] T012 Create storage utilities in `lib/nhost/storage.ts` (upload, download, delete file helpers)
- [x] T013 Setup GraphQL client in `lib/nhost/graphql/client.ts` with Nhost authentication headers
- [x] T014 [P] Create base GraphQL queries in `lib/nhost/graphql/queries.ts` (users, organizations, positions)
- [x] T015 [P] Create base GraphQL mutations in `lib/nhost/graphql/mutations.ts` (create/update/delete operations)
- [x] T016 [P] Implement GraphQL input validation for all mutations with schema validation (FR-032)
- [x] T017 Run GraphQL codegen script added to package.json (`pnpm codegen`)
- [x] T018 Create custom hooks: `lib/hooks/use-auth.ts` for authentication state and methods
- [x] T019 [P] Create custom hooks: `lib/hooks/use-file-upload.ts` for file upload with retry logic
- [x] T020 [P] Create custom hooks: `lib/hooks/use-graphql.ts` for GraphQL operations with error handling
- [x] T021 Update middleware in `middleware.ts` to protect dashboard routes with Nhost authentication
- [x] T022 [P] Add i18n messages for authentication in `messages/en.json` (login, register, errors)
- [x] T023 [P] Add i18n messages for authentication in `messages/tr.json` (Turkish translations)

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

**Note**: Nhost automatically refreshes tokens every 15 minutes. Session state is managed by Nhost SDK.

- [ ] T091 [P] [US3] Create E2E application submission test in `tests/e2e/graphql.spec.ts`

### Implementation for User Story 3

#### Backend Prerequisites (Handled in separate backend repository)

**TODO for Backend Team:**
- Database tables required: `roles`, `user_roles`, `organizations`, `positions`, `questionnaires`, `applications`, `files`, `file_metadata`
- Table relationships: Configure foreign keys, one-to-many, many-to-many in Hasura console
- RLS policies: Row-level security based on user roles (admin, employer, candidate)
- Seed data: Initial roles (admin, employer, candidate)
- GraphQL schema: Ensure all queries/mutations are exposed via Hasura

**Frontend Dependency**: Backend must be deployed with schema from `specs/002-nhost-integration/data-model.md` and GraphQL contracts from `specs/002-nhost-integration/contracts/schema.graphql.md`

#### GraphQL Operations (Frontend)

- [ ] T092 [P] Implement organization queries in `lib/nhost/graphql/queries.ts` (list, get by ID, filter, sort)
- [ ] T093 [P] Implement position queries in `lib/nhost/graphql/queries.ts` (list, get by ID, filter by status)
- [ ] T094 [P] Implement application queries in `lib/nhost/graphql/queries.ts` (user applications, position applications)
- [ ] T095 [P] Implement questionnaire queries in `lib/nhost/graphql/queries.ts`
- [ ] T096 Implement organization mutations in `lib/nhost/graphql/mutations.ts` (create, update, delete)
- [ ] T097 Implement position mutations in `lib/nhost/graphql/mutations.ts` (create, update, delete, publish, close)
- [ ] T098 Implement application mutations in `lib/nhost/graphql/mutations.ts` (submit, update status, add notes)
- [ ] T099 Implement questionnaire mutations in `lib/nhost/graphql/mutations.ts` (create, update, delete)
- [ ] T100 Add pagination support to all list queries (FR-034: limit, offset)
- [ ] T101 Add filtering support to queries (FR-033: where clauses for common fields)
- [ ] T102 Add sorting support to queries (FR-033: order_by clauses)
- [ ] T103 Regenerate TypeScript types from GraphQL schema using codegen

#### UI Components & Pages

- [ ] T104 Create organizations page in `app/[locale]/(dashboard)/organizations/page.tsx` listing user's orgs
- [ ] T105 Create organization form component for create/edit in `components/organizations/organization-form.tsx`
- [ ] T106 Create positions page in `app/[locale]/(dashboard)/positions/page.tsx` listing available positions
- [ ] T107 Create position form component for create/edit in `components/positions/position-form.tsx`
- [ ] T108 Add position status transitions (draft ‚Üí published ‚Üí closed) with validation
- [ ] T109 Create application form in `components/applications/application-form.tsx` for submission
- [ ] T110 Add questionnaire display component in `components/questionnaires/questionnaire-view.tsx`
- [ ] T111 Implement GraphQL error handling with i18n messages in `lib/nhost/graphql/client.ts` (FR-047)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
2. **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
3. **User Story 1 (Phase 3 - P1)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Authentication is MVP foundation
4. **User Story 5 (Phase 4 - P1)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Session management extends authentication
5. **User Story 2 (Phase 5 - P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 - File upload requires authentication
6. **User Story 3 (Phase 6 - P2)**: Depends on User Stories 1 & 5 - GraphQL operations require auth
7. **User Story 4 (Phase 7 - P3)**: Depends on User Story 3 - Real-time updates extend GraphQL
8. **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Authentication)**: Foundation - must complete first
- **US5 (Session Management)**: Extends US1 - complete immediately after US1
- **US2 (File Storage)**: Independent after US1 - can run parallel to US3
- **US3 (Data Management)**: Independent after US1 & US5 - can run parallel to US2
- **US4 (Real-time Sync)**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - single-user-per-client model, no real-time collaboration needed

### Recommended Execution Order

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
```
Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Foundational) ‚Üí Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üí Phase 4 (US5)
```

**Full Feature Set**:
```
Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üí Phase 4 (US5) ‚Üí Phase 5 (US2) || Phase 6 (US3) ‚Üí Phase 7 (Polish)
```

### Parallel Opportunities

After Foundational phase (Phase 2):
- **US2 (File Storage)** and **US3 (Data Management)** can be implemented in parallel by different team members
- All tasks marked `[P]` within a phase can run in parallel

**Example Parallel Execution in Phase 3 (US1)**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Component tests
npm test -- components/auth/__tests__/login-form.test.tsx
npm test -- components/auth/__tests__/register-form.test.tsx
npm test -- components/auth/__tests__/password-reset-form.test.tsx

# Terminal 2: E2E tests (run sequentially due to browser sharing)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts

# Terminal 3: Component implementation
# Work on T030-T050 in sequence
```

**Example Parallel Execution in Phase 6 (US3)**:
```bash
# Developer 1: Database schema
# Tasks T088-T096 (Hasura migrations)

# Developer 2: GraphQL operations
# Tasks T097-T108 (queries, mutations, codegen)

# Developer 3: UI components
# Tasks T109-T118 (pages and forms)
```

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 133 (frontend-only, backend tasks moved to TODO)
- **Setup**: 7 tasks (added reCAPTCHA config)
- **Foundational**: 16 tasks (BLOCKING, added validation task)
- **US1 (Authentication - P1)**: 32 tasks (8 tests + 24 implementation, added RBAC and account deletion)
- **US5 (Session Management - P1)**: 8 tasks (3 tests + 5 implementation, simplified with Nhost auto-refresh)
- **US2 (File Storage - P2)**: 22 tasks (6 tests + 16 implementation)
- **US3 (Data Management - P2)**: 28 tasks (5 tests + 23 implementation, backend DB tasks in TODO)
- **US4 (Real-time Sync - P3)**: REMOVED (not needed for single-user-per-client)
- **Polish**: 20 tasks (added edge case docs, infrastructure docs, backend requirements doc)

**MVP Scope** (Recommended first delivery):
- Phase 1 (Setup): 7 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 16 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Authentication): 32 tasks
- Phase 4 (US5 - Session Management): 8 tasks
- **Total MVP**: 63 tasks (frontend-only)

**Estimated Timeline** (1 developer, TDD approach):
- MVP: 3-4 weeks (assumes backend API ready)
- Full feature set: 5-6 weeks (frontend implementation only)
- With 2-3 developers (parallel execution): 3-4 weeks for full feature set

**Backend Dependency**: Backend team must implement database schema per data-model.md before US3 implementation can begin.

**Parallel Capacity**:
- Setup: 4 tasks can run in parallel
- Foundational: 7 tasks can run in parallel
- User Stories: US2 and US3 can run in parallel after US1+US5
- Tests within story: 5-8 tests can run in parallel

**Critical Path**:
```
Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 (Auth) ‚Üí US5 (Session) ‚Üí [US2 || US3] ‚Üí Polish
```

**Key Simplifications**:
- Nhost manages sessions and token refresh (auto-refresh every 15 minutes)
- Backend handles database schema, migrations, and RLS policies (separate repository)
- Nhost built-in monitoring for observability (FR-043 to FR-048)
- No real-time subscriptions needed (single-user-per-client model)

**Backend Dependencies**:
- Database schema must match `specs/002-nhost-integration/data-model.md`
- GraphQL API must expose queries/mutations per `specs/002-nhost-integration/contracts/schema.graphql.md`
- Backend team coordinates schema changes via separate repository

**Success Validation**: All 12 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-012) covered by tasks and tests.
