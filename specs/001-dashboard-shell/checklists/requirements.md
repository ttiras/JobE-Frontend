# Specification Quality Checklist: Dashboard Shell & Navigation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Pass âœ…

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses entirely on what users need and why, with no mention of specific technologies (Next.js, React, TypeScript, etc.)

2. **Requirement Completeness**: 
   - All 21 functional requirements are clear and testable (15 original + 6 new for language support)
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements use reasonable defaults
   - Success criteria include specific metrics (2 clicks, 200ms response, 100ms language switch, 320px min width, etc.)
   - All success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not implementation)
   - Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios (6 user stories including new language switching story)
   - Edge cases comprehensively identified (8 scenarios including language fallback and API content)
   - Scope clearly bounded with assumptions section (including i18n JSON files, LTR languages, etc.)

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - 6 user stories with clear priorities (P1: Navigation, Responsive, Language, Accessibility; P2: Organization Switching, Wayfinding)
   - Primary flows covered: navigation, responsiveness, organization switching, language switching, wayfinding, accessibility
   - Success criteria directly align with user stories (including bilingual support metrics)
   - No implementation leakage (e.g., didn't specify i18n library, translation management tool, or state management approach)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No additional clarifications needed
- Assumptions documented clearly (flat navigation for MVP, max 50 orgs, auth handled separately, i18n via JSON files)
- User goals from original request incorporated (responsive, shadcn/ui patterns will be in implementation, progressive activation, accessibility, multi-tenant foundation)
- **Updated 2025-10-22**: Added bilingual support (English/Turkish) per constitution amendment v1.0.2
  - New User Story 4: Language Switching (P1)
  - 6 new functional requirements (FR-016 through FR-021)
  - 2 new edge cases for translation fallback
  - 3 new success criteria for language support
  - Updated Key Entities to include Language Context
  - Updated assumptions with i18n implementation details
