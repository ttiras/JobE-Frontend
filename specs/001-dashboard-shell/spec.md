# Feature Specification: Dashboard Shell & Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `001-dashboard-shell`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create the foundational dashboard layout and navigation structure that serves as the container for all JobE features. This shell establishes the UI/UX patterns, routing structure, and provides a visual map of the entire application."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: For a production dashboard serving HR professionals with sensitive organizational data, what level of observability is required for navigation and context-switching operations? → A: Basic error logging with user-facing error messages (log critical failures like org switch errors, failed navigation, translation loading failures with user-friendly error IDs)
- Q: How should the dashboard determine which navigation items a user can access? → A: Role-based access control (RBAC) with predefined roles (e.g., Admin, HR Manager, Viewer - navigation filtered by role)
- Q: When a user switches organizations, how should the dashboard handle data synchronization to ensure a smooth user experience? → A: Optimistic UI with background sync (immediately update header/context, show loading states on data-dependent sections while fetching org-specific data)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Navigate Between Main Sections (Priority: P1)

An HR professional logs into JobE and needs to access different areas of the application (organizations, positions, questionnaires, analytics, settings). They should be able to navigate quickly between these sections using clear, accessible navigation.

**Why this priority**: Without basic navigation, users cannot access any features. This is the foundation that enables all other functionality. Navigation must be intuitive and follow HR professionals' mental models of their workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and clicking through all navigation items. Each navigation item should highlight when active, and clicking should load the correct section. Success is measured by user's ability to reach any main section within 2 clicks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on the dashboard home page, **When** they click on "Organizations" in the sidebar, **Then** they are taken to the organizations page and the Organizations nav item is highlighted
2. **Given** user is viewing the positions page, **When** they click on "Analytics" in the sidebar, **Then** they are taken to the analytics page and the Analytics nav item is highlighted
3. **Given** user is on any page, **When** they press Tab repeatedly, **Then** all navigation items receive focus in logical order with visible focus indicators
4. **Given** user is on mobile device, **When** they tap the menu icon, **Then** the navigation menu opens and displays all sections
5. **Given** user is on any page, **When** they click the JobE logo, **Then** they return to the dashboard home page

### User Story 2 - Responsive Layout Across Devices (Priority: P1)

An HR professional accesses JobE from their desktop computer in the office, their laptop at home, and their tablet during meetings. The dashboard should adapt to each screen size while maintaining full functionality and usability.

**Why this priority**: HR professionals work in various contexts and devices. A responsive design ensures accessibility and productivity regardless of device. This is foundational for mobile-first design principle in the constitution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by resizing the browser window or accessing from different devices. Navigation should remain accessible, content should reflow appropriately, and no functionality should be lost on smaller screens.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses dashboard on desktop (>1024px), **When** page loads, **Then** sidebar navigation is always visible alongside main content
2. **Given** user accesses dashboard on tablet (768-1024px), **When** page loads, **Then** sidebar collapses to icons only with tooltips, expanding on hover
3. **Given** user accesses dashboard on mobile (<768px), **When** page loads, **Then** navigation is hidden behind a hamburger menu that opens as an overlay
4. **Given** user is on mobile with navigation open, **When** they tap outside the navigation or tap the close icon, **Then** navigation closes and content is accessible
5. **Given** user rotates their tablet from portrait to landscape, **When** orientation changes, **Then** layout adjusts smoothly without losing scroll position or state

---

### User Story 3 - Organization Switching (Priority: P2)

An HR consultant managing multiple client organizations needs to switch between different organizations' data. They should be able to select an organization from a dropdown in the header and have all content update to show that organization's data.

**Why this priority**: Supports multi-tenant architecture. While not required for initial single-organization users, this enables the platform to scale to consultants and enterprise users managing multiple organizations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple test organizations and verifying that switching updates the context. All subsequent navigation should show data for the selected organization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has access to multiple organizations, **When** they click the organization selector in the header, **Then** a dropdown displays all their accessible organizations
2. **Given** organization dropdown is open, **When** user selects a different organization, **Then** the dropdown closes, the header updates to show new org name, and a loading indicator appears while context switches
3. **Given** user switches organizations, **When** the switch completes, **Then** all dashboard content refreshes to show the selected organization's data
4. **Given** user has only one organization, **When** they view the header, **Then** the organization name displays but is not clickable (no dropdown)
5. **Given** user switches organizations, **When** they navigate to a different page, **Then** the organization context persists across pages

---

### User Story 4 - Language Switching (Priority: P1)

An HR professional who prefers Turkish or English needs to switch the application language. The entire interface, including navigation labels, buttons, and system messages, should update to the selected language. The language preference should persist across sessions.

**Why this priority**: Bilingual support (English/Turkish) is foundational per the constitution. This must be available from day one to serve both international and Turkish market users. Language is as critical as navigation for usability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by switching between English and Turkish languages and verifying that all UI text updates correctly. The preference should persist after browser refresh and across different pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is viewing the dashboard in English, **When** they click the language selector in the header, **Then** a dropdown displays "English" and "Türkçe" (Turkish) options
2. **Given** language dropdown is open, **When** user selects "Türkçe", **Then** all navigation labels, page titles, buttons, and system text immediately update to Turkish
3. **Given** user has selected Turkish as their language, **When** they refresh the browser or return after closing the tab, **Then** the interface remains in Turkish
4. **Given** user switches language, **When** they navigate to different sections, **Then** all content in those sections displays in the selected language
5. **Given** user views the dashboard on mobile, **When** they access the language selector, **Then** it is easily accessible in the mobile navigation menu
6. **Given** user is on a page with user-generated content (like organization names), **When** they switch languages, **Then** UI elements change but user data remains as entered

### User Story 5 - Visual Hierarchy and Wayfinding (Priority: P2)

An HR professional using JobE for the first time should immediately understand where they are in the application, what sections are available, and how to navigate to their goal. The interface should provide clear visual cues about current location and available actions.

**Why this priority**: Clear information architecture reduces cognitive load, decreases training time, and improves user satisfaction. This aligns with the constitution's progressive disclosure principle.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested through user observation and navigation audit. Users should be able to identify their current location, understand what each section does, and find target pages within 3 clicks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on any page, **When** they look at the navigation, **Then** the current section is clearly highlighted with a distinct visual treatment (color, background, or indicator)
2. **Given** user is viewing any page, **When** they look at the page header, **Then** they see a clear page title and optional breadcrumb trail showing their location
3. **Given** user hovers over navigation items, **When** the pointer enters the nav item area, **Then** they see a visual hover state and (if collapsed) a tooltip with the full section name
4. **Given** user has collapsed the sidebar, **When** they view the navigation, **Then** they see recognizable icons for each section that match industry conventions
5. **Given** user is on a deeply nested page, **When** they view the breadcrumbs, **Then** they can click any breadcrumb level to navigate back up the hierarchy

### User Story 6 - Keyboard Navigation and Accessibility (Priority: P1)

An HR professional with motor impairments or who prefers keyboard navigation should be able to access all dashboard features using only the keyboard. Screen reader users should be able to understand the structure and navigate efficiently.

**Why this priority**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is non-negotiable per the constitution. Keyboard navigation is essential for accessibility and power users. This must be foundational, not retrofitted.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested using only keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys) and screen reader software. All interactive elements should be reachable and operable without a mouse.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user navigates with keyboard only, **When** they press Tab from the logo, **Then** focus moves to the first navigation item with a visible focus indicator
2. **Given** user has focused a navigation item, **When** they press Enter or Space, **Then** they navigate to that section
3. **Given** user has opened mobile navigation menu via keyboard, **When** they press Escape, **Then** the menu closes and focus returns to the menu button
4. **Given** screen reader user loads the dashboard, **When** the page loads, **Then** they hear a landmark announcement identifying the navigation region and main content region
5. **Given** user navigates with keyboard, **When** focus moves between elements, **Then** focus order follows visual order (left to right, top to bottom)
6. **Given** user is on a navigation item with keyboard, **When** they press Tab, **Then** focus moves to the next navigation item (not child elements unless section is expanded)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's session expires while they're navigating between sections? (System should preserve intended destination and redirect after re-authentication)
- How does navigation handle when a user doesn't have permission to access a particular section? (Navigation items not permitted by user's role are hidden from the sidebar; attempting direct URL access redirects to dashboard home with permission denied message)
- What happens on extremely narrow screens (<320px)? (Layout should still be functional, even if less optimal)
- How does the system handle navigation when the backend is unreachable? (Show cached navigation structure, display connection status, gracefully degrade)
- What happens when organization switching fails due to network error? (Show error message, maintain current organization context, allow retry)
- How does navigation behave when user has tens of organizations? (Implement search/filter in organization dropdown after >10 organizations)
- What happens when a translation is missing for the selected language? (Fall back to English default, log missing translation for future fix)
- How does language switching behave with dynamic content from APIs? (UI language changes, but API response language depends on backend i18n support)

### Assumptions

- Organization switching uses optimistic UI pattern: header/context updates immediately, data-dependent sections show loading states while fetching org-specific data in background
- Navigation structure is flat (one level deep) for MVP; nested navigation will be added in future iterations if needed
- User authentication and session management are handled by a separate authentication feature
- Mobile navigation menu opens as an overlay (not push content to side) for better space utilization
- Maximum of 50 organizations per user for MVP (pagination or search required beyond this)
- Logo and brand assets will be provided separately
- User profile/settings functionality will be implemented in a separate feature
- Language translations will be maintained in JSON files (one per language: en.json, tr.json)
- All static UI text will have translation keys; user-generated content remains in original language
- Default language is English; Turkish is selected explicitly by user
- Right-to-left (RTL) support is not required (both English and Turkish are LTR languages)

### Key Entities

- **Navigation Item**: Represents a top-level section in the application (label, icon, route path, required roles for access, active state indicator)
- **Organization Context**: Represents the currently selected organization (ID, name, logo, user's role in that organization)
- **User Session**: Represents the authenticated user (name, email, accessible organizations, current organization, role per organization, preferences for sidebar state and language)
- **User Role**: Represents predefined access levels (Admin, HR Manager, Viewer) with associated navigation permissions
- **Layout State**: Represents the current UI state (sidebar collapsed/expanded, mobile menu open/closed, viewport size category)
- **Language Context**: Represents the currently selected language (locale code: 'en' or 'tr', display name, text direction)
